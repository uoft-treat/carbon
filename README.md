# Carbon <small>(6, 12.011)</small>

Carbon is a real-time RPEL and rendering engine for TREAT widgets.

It magically constructs a TREAT experiment from a XML definition.

## Concepts

### Virtual DOM

Carbon constructs an virtual DOM under-the-hood. The virtual DOM is used to then construct the real DOM in your browser.

### RPEL

Carbon uses Babel to REPL widget scripts. Thus you can use modern syntax with no issues at all.
